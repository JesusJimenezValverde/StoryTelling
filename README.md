# StoryTelling

Story Telling is a proyect made in Processing and SuperCollider.
This has the intention to tell a story by the images shown in the Processing console. Those images are controlled by the music that's being produced by the superCollider program.

### How is this made?
The SuperCollider program sends Midi Notes to the processing one, that notes are the ones in charge to tell the visual objects to move. So, the story has sense when everything is running and the times between actions are coordinated.
